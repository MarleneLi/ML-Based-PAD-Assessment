In this project, we employed machine learning techniques to assess PAD risk using EHR data. The use of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Deep Learning Neural Networks allowed us to identify key risk factors, notably leg pain, age, and blood glucose levels. These were consistently significant across models, highlighting their importance in PAD assessment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in enhancing early PAD detection and improving diagnostic accuracy in healthcare. 

The data preprocessing for our project was conducted using R, while the algorithm implementation was carried out in Python. Due to privacy agreements, our work was performed exclusively online on the _All of Us_ Research website. As a result, **the code is not executable outside this platform, and direct downloads will not function**. However, the outcomes of our analyses, including the results and insights gleaned from the machine learning models, are comprehensively documented in the notebooks available on the github, ensuring transparency and accessibility of our findings despite the restrictions on code usage.
